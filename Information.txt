BatchInternal.py
========================================================
1.Takes processed_encoded.csv
2.Takes mixture_model.csv
3.Outputs internal_validation.csv


1.Takes processed_encoded.csv
2.Takes mixture_model.csv
3.Outputs validation_validation.csv



Indexes To Apply
--------------------
1.Sil , Db, CVNN, Xb , Dunns , SD



Steps
--------------------
1.Rename processed encode to data.csv and put inside /dataset/    (This file should not contain any column headings)
2.Add the word data to the clustering result and put in /clustering result/ 	(This file should not contain any column headings)
	a.change "mixture_model.csv" (received from total_results.csv during clustering) to "mixture_model_data.csv"
	b.change "graph_closure.csv" (received from total_results.csv during clustering) to "graph_closure_data.csv"

	Note:
	a.Graph Closure(or Mixture Model) columns that assign the same label to each member will give error.Remove these columns
	b.Graph Closure(or Mixture Model) columns that do not assign members to a certain group will give error.Remove these columns
		Example : Graph closure 0.7 gives 20 clusters but there is no one in cluster 2.So it assigned members to cluster 1 and 3.But
			  no one to 2.
	
3.Output file will be in /internal result/




composite_validation.py(4 results required - F1,F2,F3)
======================================================
1.Takes internal validation result as input
2.Merge folder 1(mixture_mode internal validation result and graph closure internal validation result )
3.Merge folder 2(mixture_mode internal validation result and graph closure internal validation result )
4.Merge folder 3(mixture_mode internal validation result and graph closure internal validation result )
5.Merge folder 1,2,3
5.Make sure to indicate the index of the indexes(on the far right of excel sheet) in (line 6) 
	a.Open csv(excel) 
	b.Go to file>options>formulas>
	c.Under working with formulas, tick "RIC1 reference style"
	d.Go back and check column of CVM indices and subtract 1(because we count from 0)
	e.Give appropriate name for output file on line 104
